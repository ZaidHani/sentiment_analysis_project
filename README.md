# sentiment_analysis_project

this is a personal project that was made by Zaid Hani Allwansah, I've used nltk to clean the text from the amazon reviews data, and then throw the cleaned words into a bag of words, and finally used Naive Bayes to predict the rating of the reviews using the bag of words.
